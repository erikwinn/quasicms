Note: the following are instructions from a couple of years ago and a couple of QCodo versions ago ..
there is a QCodo 0.3.4 (roughly ..) included that may work but probably will not unless your system
is quite old. Development on QuasiCMS has slowed down in favor of some other projects. I am making
this available for reference and interest only at the moment

These notes are included for historical purposes - THIS README WILL BE REPLACED AS SOON AS THERE
IS A NEW RELEASE, until then this whole repository is NOT RECOMMENDED for use unless you are
a developer and curious .. as soon as development resumes in ernest I have some radical changes planned
so do not depend on the structure or API.

***************************************************************************************

Sun Nov 30 2008:
 This is the 0.2-beta release of Quasi - it is functional but very rough and there is a TODO list about
100 miles long .. still, it is usable and you can make a website with it. Be aware that access control is
still unimplemented and there are likely to be many bugs.
 
 Security is low (if any), USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!

This release is intended primarily for developers.

 That said, hey - it works. And if you are a developer or even have some basic programming ability you
may find it a nice framework to work with and/or learn from. I encourage you to get involved with the
project and make Quasi a "quasi-real" CMS ;).

 There is now an installer in the released zip/tgz bundled with QCodo. To install you can simply
 unpack the compressed file to a directory available to the webserver and visit <location>/install.php.
 This will optionally create a database for Quasi or you can create one before this and the installation
 will install the quasi data (optionally with example data).
  
  NOTE that the QCodo that is bundled with Quasi contains bug fixes and modifications that may
cause it not to run on stock QCodo installations.

YOU SHOULD NOT UNPACK THIS INTO AN EXISTING QCODO INSTALLATION!! Any QCodo files and
configuration will be overwritten if you do!!

 There is one other (more geeky) way to install Quasi - manually:
 
* 1. Unpack the tarball to the directory that you want to have as the root of Quasi (eg. /var/www/quasi/).
* 2. Create the quasicms database - login to mysql and run this command:

mysql> create database quasicms; grant all on quasicms.* to quasidbu identified by 'quasidbp';
  
  NOTE: You _should_ change the username and password in include/configuration.php and replace
  them in the command above with values for your server!!

* 3. Install the database:
 
   You can use the quasi-example-data.sql for a functioning example site including the core modules:
 
 you@yourserver$ mysql -u root -p < core/quasi-with-data.sql

    Or, if you prefer you can install only the default database structure with no data and no modules:
 
 you@yourserver$ mysql -u root -p < core/quasi.sql
    
 See the class comments, documentation and design notes for how to install modules (like Account).

* 6.(Optional) Edit the Qcodo generator configuration (includes/_devtools/codegen_settings.xml) to point to
core/relationships.txt like this:
  
  <relationshipsScript filepath="/path/to/your/quasiroot/core/relationships.txt" format="qcodo"/>

and then run the Qcodo code generator (includes/_devtools/codegen.php)
 
 7. Et voila - Enjoy!


 Note: you may need to give the webserver read rights to the new directories.
 "chown -R www-data.www-data /var/www/quasi/ " works on Debian ...
